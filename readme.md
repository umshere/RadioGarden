**Code Quality Improvements (Oct 2025):**

- ✅ **67% reduction** in main route file (1200+ → 393 lines)
- ✅ **11 custom hooks** extract all state management logic
- ✅ **Separated concerns**: UI, state, effects, handlers, derived data
- ✅ **DRY principles** eliminate code duplication
- ✅ **Clean architecture** with clear separation of responsibilities

## 🎯 Implementation Status (Updated Oct 26, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Features

**Travel Trail Player**

- Replaced vertical stack with horizontal, scroll-snapping trail
- Active card now expands inline with badges, tags, and controls
- Resume/Next controls live on the active card
- Always visible: no collapsible queue required
- Animated dotted connector communicates progression and keyboard navigation is supported

**Station Normalisation Layer**

- New `normalizeStations` utility converts Radio Browser payloads to our internal types
- Drops broken stations (missing uuid/name/url) and casts bitrate/codec safely
- Guarantees dedupe logic works across recent, explore, and country feeds

**Radio Browser Hygiene**

- Every fetch path (loader, quick retune, “surprise me”, explore mode) now runs through the normaliser
- Ready to surface additional metadata (e.g. `lastcheckok`) without reworking consumers
- Trail and station grid surface health/trending badges derived from normalised metadata

**Quick Retune + Atlas Improvements**

- Scroll targets adjusted for the always-on travel trail
- Continent selects continue to respect listening mode and atlas focus

## 📡 Radio Browser Normalisation

Radio Browser responses expose dozens of fields (`stationuuid`, `url_resolved`, `lastcheckok`, etc.).
Our `app/utils/stations.ts` helper converts those payloads into the lean `Station` shape the UI
expects:

- Enforces required fields (`uuid`, `name`, `url`); broken entries are ignored.
- Prefers `url_resolved` when present, but gracefully falls back to `url`.
- Normalises country codes, tags, and bitrate values so dedupe logic stays reliable.
- Keeps homepage links for stations without stream URLs so the UI can offer a "Visit station" fallback.

With a single ingestion point it’s easy to add more user-facing context later (e.g. stream
reliability badges, trending signals) without touching every consumer.

### 📋 Next Steps

**E2E Tests:** Skeleton states, mode toggle, scroll behavior, cross-browser  
**UX Polish:** Tooltips, ARIA labels, copy refinement

## 🌟 Key Statistics
